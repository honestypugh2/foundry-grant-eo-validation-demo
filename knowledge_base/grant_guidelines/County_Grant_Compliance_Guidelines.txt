## Expediting Legal Review

To speed up the review process:

1. **Submit Early**: Allow 2-3 weeks for legal review before grant deadline
2. **Use Templates**: Utilize provided compliance templates and checklists
3. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed, specific information rather than generalizations
4. **Include Citations**: Reference specific executive orders, regulations, or precedents
5. **Anticipate Questions**: Address potential concerns proactively in your application
6. **Provide Context**: Explain how your project differs from or builds on previous grants

## Red Flags That Trigger Additional Scrutiny

Legal review will be more intensive if your proposal:
- Involves new or untested program models
- Serves vulnerable populations (children, elderly, persons with disabilities)
- Includes significant construction or capital improvements
- Requires environmental assessments
- Involves partnerships with for-profit entities
- Exceeds $1 million in total funding
- Has potential for significant public attention or controversy

## Working with Legal Counsel

### When to Consult Legal Early:
- Innovative or unusual project approaches
- Questions about eligibility or allowable activities
- Complex partnership or subcontracting arrangements
- Concerns about potential compliance issues
- Previous grant audit findings to address

### What to Bring to Consultation:
- Draft grant application
- Funding opportunity announcement
- List of specific questions or concerns
- Relevant background documents
- Timeline and deadlines

## After Legal Approval

Once your grant receives legal approval:
1. Incorporate any required changes or clarifications
2. Obtain final signatures before submission
3. Keep legal office informed if you receive the grant
4. Consult legal if grant terms change during negotiation
5. Maintain compliance throughout grant performance period
