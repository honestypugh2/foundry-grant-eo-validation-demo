**Signed:** January 20, 2021  
**Federal Register Number:** 86 FR 7009  
**Status:** Active

## Overview

This executive order advances equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. It directs federal agencies to assess whether their programs and policies perpetuate systemic barriers to opportunities and benefits for underserved communities.

## Policy Statement

Equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country's greatest strengths. But for too many, the American Dream remains out of reach. The Federal Government must affirmatively advance equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity.

## Key Provisions

- Members of religious minorities
- Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) persons
- Persons with disabilities
- Persons in rural areas
- Persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality

1. **Conduct Equity Assessments**
   - Review existing policies and programs

- Accessibility accommodations missing or inadequate

## Equity Assessment Framework

When evaluating a project for equity compliance, consider:

1. **Who Benefits?**
   - Are underserved communities specifically included?
   - What percentage of beneficiaries are from target groups?
   - How are benefits distributed?

2. **Who Decides?**
   - Are underserved communities involved in decision-making?
   - How is their input incorporated?
   - Who has power and authority in the project?

3. **Who Is Excluded?**
   - What barriers might prevent participation?
   - Are accommodations provided?
   - How will you reach the hardest-to-reach?

4. **What Changes?**
   - Does the project address root causes of inequity?
   - What systemic changes result from the project?
   - How is long-term impact ensured?

## Continuous Improvement

Equity work is ongoing. Projects should:
- Regularly assess equity impacts
- Solicit ongoing community feedback
- Adjust strategies based on data and input
- Share lessons learned
- Build organizational equity capacity
- Maintain accountability to underserved communities

**Implementation Date**: January 20, 2021  
**Equity Assessment Deadline**: 200 days from order (varied by agency)  
**Ongoing Requirement**: Annual equity assessments and action plans

This executive order represents a fundamental shift in how federal programs approach equity. Grant programs must proactively advance equity rather than simply avoiding discrimination.

**Remember**: Equity is not treating everyone the same—it's ensuring everyone has what they need to thrive. Projects should be designed with and for underserved communities, removing barriers and advancing opportunities for those who have been historically excluded.

For detailed guidance specific to your grant program, consult your agency's equity action plan and equity team.
